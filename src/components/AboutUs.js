      <p>
        My name is Antonio Macan, and I am currently working on the Medusa Store
        project as part of my internship at Agilo company. I am thrilled to have
        this opportunity and eager to improve my skills further. This project is
        just a glimpse of what I am capable of, and I am highly motivated and
        dedicated to this task. I am always seeking ways to enhance my abilities
        and deliver outstanding results.
