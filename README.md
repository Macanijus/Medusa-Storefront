# Medusa Store

Medusa Store is a small online store for clothes built with Medusa Store API. It allows users to browse and select products, add them to the cart, and choose the size before making a purchase. This project showcases the basic functionality of an e-commerce store.

## Project Overview

The project aims to provide a simple and intuitive user interface for an online clothing store. Users can view all available products, select their desired items, add them to the cart, and proceed to checkout. The project is implemented using React and utilizes Medusa Store API for fetching and managing product data.

### Key Features

1.Display all products available in the store.

2.Enable users to choose the size before adding products to the cart.

3.Implement a shopping cart functionality to add and remove products.

4.Create a responsive layout for seamless user experience across devices.


### Project Details

Duration: 2 weeks

Technology: React, Medusa Store API

Styling: Basic CSS

### Challenges Faced

The most challenging part of the project was implementing the shopping cart functionality. Although it was not a required feature, I took the initiative to include it to enhance the user experience. It required careful handling of product data, managing cart state, and implementing add/remove functionality. Despite the challenges, I successfully implemented a functional and user-friendly cart.

### Areas of Pride

I'm particularly proud of the shopping cart implementation. It was an extra effort I put into the project, and I'm satisfied with the functionality and user experience it provides. It allowed me to expand my skills and showcase my ability to go beyond the given requirements.

## Future Improvements

While the project meets the basic requirements, there are areas for further enhancement:

1.Implement better styling using Tailwind CSS for a more polished and professional appearance.

2.Learn and incorporate TypeScript into the project to improve code reliability and maintainability.

3.Explore additional features such as user authentication, wishlist, and order tracking.
