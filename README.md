# Medusa Store

Medusa Store is a small online store for clothes built with Medusa Store API. It allows users to browse and select products, add them to the cart, and choose the size before making a purchase. This project showcases the basic functionality of an e-commerce store.

## Project Overview

The project aims to provide a simple and intuitive user interface for an online clothing store. Users can view all available products, select their desired items, add them to the cart, and proceed to checkout. The project is implemented using React and utilizes Medusa Store API for fetching and managing product data.

### Key Features

1.Display all products available in the store.
2.Enable users to choose the size before adding products to the cart.
3.Implement a shopping cart functionality to add and remove products.
4.Create a responsive layout for seamless user experience across devices.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
